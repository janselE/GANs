# GANs

In this project we adjusted the example of GANs given in https://skymind.ai/wiki/generative-adversarial-network-gan and we modify it to detect the difference between spam emails and normal emails. You can find the database of those emails at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase.
